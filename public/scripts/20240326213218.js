// This code is inspired by the first and last snippets provided, integrating the theme of geometric transformation and animation loop in WEBGL from the last one, while incorporating the monochrome aesthetic and simplicity from the first snippet. The twist here is the use of opacity to represent depth and an additional twist with sphere sizes that dynamically change based on their position in the animation loop, creating a monochromatic universe of expanding and contracting spheres.

let f = 0;
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600, WEBGL);
  noStroke();
}

function draw() {
  background(0);
  rotateY(f);
  let opacity, sphereSize;
  // Creating a grid of spheres
  for (let u = 0; u < TAU; u += PI / 24) {
    for (let v = PI / 2; v <= 3 * PI / 2; v += PI / 24) {
      push();
      let r = 200 * cos(v + f / 20); // Updated radius for dynamic movement
      translate(sin(u) * r, cos(u) * r, sin(v) * r);
      // Dynamically changing opacity and size based on sphere's position
      opacity = map(abs(r), 0, 200, 255, 50);
      sphereSize = map(sin(f / 10), -1, 1, 2, 12) * (1 + sin(v + f / 20));
      fill(255, opacity);
      sphere(sphereSize);
      pop();
    }
  }
  f += PI / 180; // Incrementing frame for animation effect
